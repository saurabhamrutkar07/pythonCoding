""" If statement """

""" The Python if statement is similar to other programming languages. It executes a block of statements conditionally, based on a Boolean expression. """


""" if else statement """

""" In Python, the if..else statement has two blocks: one for when the condition is True and another for when the condition is False. """

""" When there are multiple conditions to check, you can use the elif clause (short for "else if"). Python evaluates each condition one by one until it finds one that is True. If none are True, the else block is executed. """
